# jxr2png

Converts HDR JPEG XR (`.jxr`) images, such as Windows Game Bar and Xbox HDR
screenshots, to PNG. Runs on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Each input can produce:

- **HDR PNG**: 16-bit, Rec.2020 primaries with the PQ transfer function and a
  `cICP` chunk, so HDR-aware viewers and browsers display it in HDR.
- **SDR PNG**: tone-mapped 8-bit sRGB for everything else.

> Work in progress: the project skeleton is in place, and JXR decoding is
> being added next.
